OOP User Registration and Management

This project is a simple User Registration and Management System built using PHP with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. It allows both users and admins to register, log in, and manage users via a dedicated admin dashboard. The system is styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.

Features:

1.User Registration and Login: Users can register with unique credentials and log in securely.

2.Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage user accounts (add, edit, delete) and view user details.

3.Flash Messaging: Displays success or error messages to notify users/admins after actions such as registration, login, and account updates. Flash messages automatically disappear after 5 seconds.

4.Tailwind CSS: Integrated for styling the front-end, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

5.Secure Authentication: Admin and user login features ensure proper session handling and security.
