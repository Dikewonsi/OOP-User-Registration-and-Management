OOP User Registration and Management

This project is the result of my journey as a PHP developer transitioning from procedural programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). After spending 4 years in the procedural PHP world, I wanted to challenge myself by building something more structured and maintainable. I started with basic register and login functions, but as I delved deeper into OOP, I expanded this project into a full User Registration and Management System.

This system allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts, while admins have the ability to control and manage users through a dedicated admin dashboard. My goal with this project is not just to improve functionality but also to make the codebase more organized and scalable, without the complexities of MVC, which can be overwhelming for those still learning OOPâ€”like me when I started this journey!

Features:

1.User Registration and Login: Users can register with unique credentials and log in securely.

2.Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage user accounts (add, edit, delete) and view user details.

3.Flash Messaging: Displays success or error messages to notify users/admins after actions such as registration, login, and account updates. Flash messages automatically disappear after 5 seconds.

4.Tailwind CSS: Integrated for styling the front-end, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

5.Secure Authentication: Admin and user login features ensure proper session handling and security.
